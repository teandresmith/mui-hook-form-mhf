# RHF States

MHF was developed to allow RHF to handle all underlying state. Because of that, all MHF components
are considered as uncontrolled components. For some, that may be troublesome because they may
require to access the state throughout its life expectancy (before submission of course).

Thankfully, there are ways to access/see the state before it is submitted if you actually require
that. Below will be one example in both TypeScript and JavaScript of how it is possible. There may be of course other routes, but
the point of MHF isn't to completely neutralize RHF, but rather allow the integration between
MUI and RHF be a bit smoother.

_**Note:** There may be other and more efficient methods, but this is just one opinionated method of accessing RHF form data prior to submission. _

```ts
// TypeScript

interface FormData {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

const YourComponent = () => {
  const methods = useForm<FormData>()

  const onSubmit = (data: FormData) => console.log(data)

  // Data can be seen using methods.watch
  let firstName = methods.watch('firstName')

  // Anytime there is a change being made to firstName, you will be able to see/track.
  console.log(firstName)

  return (
    <form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <MHFTextField name={'firstName'} control={methods.control} />
      <MHFTextField name={'lastName'} control={methods.control} />
      <Button type='submit'>Submit</Button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

```js
// JavaScript

const YourComponent = () => {
  const methods = useForm()

  const onSubmit = (data) => console.log(data)

  // Data can be seen using methods.watch
  let firstName = methods.watch('firstName')

  // Anytime there is a change being made to firstName, you will be able to see/track.
  console.log(firstName)

  return (
    <form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <MHFTextField name={'firstName'} control={methods.control} />
      <MHFTextField name={'lastName'} control={methods.control} />
      <Button type='submit'>Submit</Button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Custom Error Messages

Not all of MHF Components provide a helper text to assist with error messages. An example of that
would be the MHFSlider or MHFLabeledSwitch component. To compensate for this, I am providing a
simple solution. The trick is to use a MUI 'FormControl' Tag and provide a 'FormHelperText' Tag.
Below will provide an example of such.

```ts
// TypeScript

interface FormData {
  sliderNumber: number
}

const YourComponent = () => {
  const methods = useForm<FormData>()

  const onSubmit = (data: FormData) => console.log(data)

  // Data can be seen using methods.watch
  let sliderNumber = methods.watch('slideNumber')
  let error = slideNumber < 10

  // Anytime there is a change being made to slideNumber, you will be able to see/track.
  console.log(slideNumber)

  return (
    <form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <FormControl error={error}>
        <MHFSlider name={'sliderNumber'} control={methods.control} />
        {slideNumber < 10 && (
          <FormHelperText>Slider value must be at least 10</FormHelperText>
        )}
      </FormControl>
      <Button type='submit'>Submit</Button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

```js
// JavaScript

const YourComponent = () => {
  const methods = useForm()

  const onSubmit = (data => console.log(data)

  // Data can be seen using methods.watch
  let sliderNumber = methods.watch('slideNumber')
  let error = slideNumber < 10

  // Anytime there is a change being made to slideNumber, you will be able to see/track.
  console.log(slideNumber)

  return (
    <form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <FormControl error={error}>
        <MHFSlider
          name={'sliderNumber'}
          control={methods.control}
        />
        {slideNumber < 10 && (
          <FormHelperText>Slider value must be at least 10</FormHelperText>
        )}
      </FormControl>
      <Button type='submit'>Submit</Button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

A more efficient way of handling this is to use RHF Controller's 'rules' prop. Below will present
one soluton.

```ts
// TypeScript

interface FormData {
  sliderNumber: number
}

const YourComponent = () => {
  const methods = useForm<FormData>()

  const onSubmit = (data: FormData) => console.log(data)

  // Data can be seen using methods.watch
  let sliderNumber = methods.watch('slideNumber')

  const rules = { min: { value: 10 } }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <FormControl error={methods.formState?.errors ? true : false}>
        <MHFSlider
          name={'sliderNumber'}
          control={methods.control}
          rules={rules}
        />
        {methods.formState?.errors && (
          <FormHelperText>Slider value must be at least 10</FormHelperText>
        )}
      </FormControl>
      <Button type='submit'>Submit</Button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

```js
// JavaScript

const YourComponent = () => {
  const methods = useForm()

  const onSubmit = (data) => console.log(data)

  // Data can be seen using methods.watch
  let sliderNumber = methods.watch('slideNumber')

  const rules = { min: { value: 10 } }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <FormControl error={methods.formState.errors ? true : false}>
        <MHFSlider
          name={'sliderNumber'}
          control={methods.control}
          rules={rules}
        />
        {methods.formState?.errors && (
          <FormHelperText>Slider value must be at least 10</FormHelperText>
        )}
      </FormControl>
      <Button type='submit'>Submit</Button>
    </form>
  )
}
```
