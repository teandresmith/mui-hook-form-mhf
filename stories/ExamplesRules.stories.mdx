# Controller Rules Prop Examples

This page will present the organization of RHF Controller's 'rules' prop. To simplify
documenation, only a few examples will be presented. For more information, please follow the links below.

_React Hook Form goes into detail about the available validation rules at: https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform/register and https://react-hook-form.com/api/usecontroller/controller _

### Max Length / Min Length Rules

In most cases, this rule would only be used with the MHFTextField and MHFAutocomplete.
It is possible to use it with other components, but it just doesn't make sense to do so in many cases.

```js

const rules = {
    maxLength: {value: 4, message: 'Maximum character limit is 4'},
    minLength: {value: 1, message: 'There must be at least 1 character'},
}

<MHFTextField name={name} control={control} rules={rules} />
```

### Validate Rule

The validate rule takes in a function that must return a boolean. If it returns true, then
the validation passes, if it returns false, then the validation fails. This can be used in all
of the components. Below is an example of using the validate rule for the MHFDatePicker that prevents
users from selecting any date within April. In all my Date/Time Pickers examples, I use the moment
date Adapter, so the implementation may be different depending on the adapter use.

```js

const rules = { validate: (data: any) => !data.toString().includes('Apr') }

<LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterMoment}>
    <MHFDatePicker name={name} control={methods.control} rules={rules} />
</LocalizationProvider>
```

### Pattern Rule

The pattern rule determines validation through RegEx. In most times, this would be used to validate
email, url or any specfic type of input. You can entirely avoid the requirement of this rule,
if you would opt to use the MHFTextField's type prop. It supports email, password, file, url and
many other HMTL5 input types. Nonetheless, below will be an example of how it can be used.

```js

const rules = { pattern: /[A-Za-z]{3}/ }

<MHFTextField name={name} control={control} rules={rules} />

```

### Max and Min Rule

The Min and Max rule can be used when setting a limitation on a numerical input. An example
of this would be if you used the MHFTextField component and set the type prop to 'number'.
Below is an example of such use.

```js

const rules = {
    max: {value: 3, message: 'Number can be no more than 3'},
    min: {value: 1, message: 'Number can be no less than 1'}
}

<MHFTextField name={name} control={control} rules={rules} type={'number'} />
```

### Required Rule

The required rule can almost be ignored as most components have a required prop built into them.
For components that do not have a required prop, it would probably be best to wrap them in MUI
'FormControl required' tag so the browser natively handles it. Another benefit of doing it this
way is that you are able to use a 'FormHelperText' tag to tell the user what is going wrong
when they are inputting an empty/error result. But, for the sake of documentation, an example
of the required rule will be below.

```js

const rules = { required: true }

<MHFSlider name={name} control={control} rules={rules} />
```
